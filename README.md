## About

In this application, you get information for celebreties that you can get a greeting from. We show some basic information for every person, plus a button that takes us to a separate screen with more details. We can sort the people by "Name" or "Price", and both could be either in "ascending" or "descending" way. We can also filter all the people by Category and we have a "Reset" button, that resets any filters or sortings we currently have.
